## Office Hack: Block Off Your Own Calendar

If you work in an office where people frequently try to send you meeting invitations, and they assume that any free period on your calendar is fair game, this is valuable technique.

Schedule a recurring chunk of time for yourself, and set it as busy. You can use a create label if the descriptions are public. 

Usually, I block off at least 3-4 hours on my own calendar for every work day. If anyone breaks protocol and tries to send me a meeting invite at that time, I automatically decline and explain that I have an existing event scheduled.

For social purposes, I always propose an alternate time that works for me. 

The most of your calendar you block off, then more you will be in charge of your time and focus at work.

## Office Hack: Turn Off Your Messaging Tool For 1-2 Hours

Real-time chats tools are VERY popular at companies these days. They are useful for support personnel, but absolutely ruinous for creative people and thought-workers. In order to solve problems effectively, you need deep focus periods, usually of 30-90 minutes. 

When you want to work without interruption, just kill your chat program for a couple of hours. I promise you, the world won't burn down.

You will get more done. You will feel more calm. You will be happier.

This is a newer technique in my arsenal. I've been doing it for just a few weeks, and have already been REALLY impressed with the results.

## Office Hack: Be An Office Nomad

If you work in an office, you are probably also used to people coming over to ask you about things in person. Whenever they have a question, they'll assume it's fine to interrupt you. 

You need to safeguard your time, and your ability to choose when you want to interact with people, and when you want to focus. 

I learned this technique from my colleague Sohail. He has a standing desk in our open office, just like the rest of us. But, he is almost never at his desk. Instead, he'll grab his laptop and pick a spot in the office far from his desk. He'll be at different spots throughout the day. 

This way, you can message him, but you can't disturb him in person unless he wants to be available. 

This is a fantastic technique. Just grab your laptop and work somewhere random. Preferably in a quiet room, or corner.

## Office Hack: Move Your Body Regularly

This is a valuable mental technique for freeing your mind. Every hour, take about 5-10 minutes and leave your work area to go do something active. 

Lift some weights. Go for a walk in the sunshine. Do some stretches. 

This reminds you the most tasks aren't urgent. It makes people used to you prioritizing health. It gives you an air of unpredictability. 

I've been using this technique for over 10 years now, and it is fantastic. Whenever someone wants to have a 1-on-1 conversations, I'll usually recommend we got for a short walk instead.

## Office Hack: Click "No" On Your Next Meeting Invite

Let's be honest, most meeting don't offer much value. You could be doing something else. Working on a project you enjoy. Getting some fresh air. Building stronger relationships. Taking a nap in your car.

Next time you get a meeting invitation that doesn't offer value to you, just click "No". If anyone asks why you aren't attending, tell them about some important work thing that is nearly due. 

Saying "No" to time-consuming, low-value activities will immediately give you the ability to choose something high-value that you actually enjoy.
