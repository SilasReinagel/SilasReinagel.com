## Chapter 4
# Recognizing Your Leverage

----

When I was much younger in my career, I didn't know what I had to offer. That limited my freedom. 

I didn't know what employers wanted.
I didn't know what to put on my resume.
I didn't know what to ask for.
I didn't know what estimates to give.
I didn't know how much to charge.
I didn't know that I could say "NO" to my boss.

I didn't realize what advantages I had, and I didn't realize that those advantage gave me leverage.

### 1. Recognize the amount of leverage you ALREADY possess

Many people that I work with have more leverage than the realize. The first step in being free is recognizing how much leverage you already have.

What are some forms of leverage that you may already have?

- You have skills that are in demand
- You have intricate business knowledge
- You have valuable social connections 
- You have more willingness to embrace conflict
- You have a unique perspective because of your role
- You have combinations of skills that others don't have
- You have a devil-may-care attitude
- You have a compelling communication style
- You have experience in areas that others don't
- etc.

Virtually no matter what your current position is, there are traits you have ALREADY which you are not fully leveraging.
