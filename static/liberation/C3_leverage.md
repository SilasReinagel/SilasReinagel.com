# Chapter 3 - The Power of Leverage

One of the key drivers of freedom is leverage. The more leverage you have, the more freedom you will have.

## Leverage Always Results In Freedom

So, in the areas of your life that you DON'T presently feel free, the solution is to utilize more leverage.

1) Recognize the amount of leverage you ALREADY possess.
2) Increase your leverage by BROADENING your options.
3) COMMUNICATE your leverage tactfully to those around you.

### What is leverage?

## Leverage is any force multiplier.

It's something that makes you MORE effective. 

More effective than who?

More effective than alternative people.

- If you are good with Python or Microsoft Excel, and your boss ISN'T, it's better for him to pay you than do it himself.
- If you are available to do a task today, and Jimmy can't start on it for a week, you are a better choice than Jimmy.
- If you create reports that are more insightful than Bob, you are a better choice than Bob.
- If you can build a website for $297, and Big Web Design Co charges $997, you are a better choice than Big Web Design Co.

Any ADVANTAGE you have can be used to give you leverage. 

Most of these advantages don't even require you to be BETTER. You just need to KNOW which advantages you have. 

Then you can utilize those ADVANTAGES to give you LEVERAGE, which gives you FREEDOM.
