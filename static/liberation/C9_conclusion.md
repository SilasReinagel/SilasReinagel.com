### Creating Your Ideal Work Culture

The ultimate goal is that everyone at the office should collaborate and work as free artisans to accomplish a common goal. That's the aim. Work should be fulfilling, meaningful, rewarding, and purely voluntary. 

So, evolving your approach at work should be adapting the way you interact to first gain more freedom and trust yourself, and secondly to help others to be more comfortable trusting and letting go of the fear-based need for control.

Try a new approach, and see what the effects are. If it's evolving in the way you want it, keep going. If it's not having the impact you wanted, change up your approach after a bit.
