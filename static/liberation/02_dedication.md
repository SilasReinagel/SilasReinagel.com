# Dedication

----

This book is dedicated to my former colleague, Tomas Eychaner, who never believed that he had *any* choices at work, no matter which company he was at and no matter how much they paid him. My hope is that nobody should have to live in such a powerful prison for so much of their life. 

It's also dedicated to [Jose Rosado](https://twitter.com/JoseRosado), who inspired me to begin writing instead of spending too much time planning, researching, and generally overthinking things. 

Lastly, this is dedicated to you, dear reader. I want you to learn how to experience pure freedom whether you have an employer providing you with a regular paycheck or whether you are working for yourself. I want you to flourish and feel fantastic every day at work! 

Thank you for supporting my writing.
