# Liberation 
## Freedom From Office Slavery

----

This book is dedicated to my former colleague Tomas Eychaner, who never believed that he had any choices at work, no matter which company he was at, and no matter how much they paid him. My hope is that no-one should have to live in such a powerful prison, for so much of their life. 

It's also dedicated to Josa Rosado, who inspired me to just begin writing, instead of trying to over plan, over research things. 

Lastly, this is dedicated to you, dear reader. I want you to learn how to experience pure freedom, whether you have an employer providing you with a regular paycheck, or whether you are working for yourself. I want you to flourish and feel fantastic every day at work! 

Thank you for supporting my writings.
