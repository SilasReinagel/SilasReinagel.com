# Dedication

----

This book is dedicated to people like you, who wish to deliver things. People of action.

We live in a world where there is a lot of talk.

More people wish to take credit for things than create things.

This book is dedicated to your journey as you learn the powerful combination of delivering completed projects as well as taking credit for those deliveries.

This book is also dedicated to [Yegor Bugayenko](https://www.yegor256.com), who has written many great [blog posts about project management](https://www.yegor256.com) and a book about many of the woes of [software projects](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Ahead-1-Yegor-Bugayenko/dp/1982063742). He has some brutally practical perspectives on projects.
