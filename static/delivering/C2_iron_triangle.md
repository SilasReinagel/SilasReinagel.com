# Chapter 2 - Constraints and the Iron Triangle

The best way to conceptualize your constraints is with the Iron Triangle.

<img src="./project-management-triangle.png" alt="Project Management Iron Triangle">

There are three inputs which determine the final output.

1. Scope
2. Cost
3. Time

Any of those three could vary.

The most you can ever hold constant, in real life, is two out of three.

In a research project, it could be that none of the three is locked in. The scope might not be known. The maximum budget might be open-ended. The time the research is allowed to take might be flexible.

However, in most projects that you will manage, at least two of these will be constrained.

It will also often be the case that the project stakeholders wish to have all three fully constrained. Experience will teach you that for any non-trivial project, this is not possible.

### Determine the Variable Constraint

In the Example Project of building a stock trading tax calculation software, it may be that Gary wants the project finished within 1 year, on a budget of $200K.

**Your job as a project manager is to determine which constraint must be the flexible one.**

If the budget is unchangeable, and the timeline is fixed, then what is unknown is the precise scope of what will be delivered.

If the scope of the project is the most important, and the budget is unchangeable, then what is unknown is exactly how long the project will take.

If the scope of the project is fixed, and their is a hard deadline, then the cost of the project is unknown.

The Iron Triangle GUARANTEES that one of the three corners will be unknown until the project is complete. It's a law of the universe, and no amount of wishful thinking or optimistic promises will change that fact.

Many clients, even experienced ones, won't wish to accept a fully uncertain third variable.

### Levels of Project Management Mastery

How well you handle this Law is one of the most important things that determines your effectiveness as a project manager.

- A POOR project manager will promise to keep all three constrained, and then be forced to make excuses near the end of the project, when the budget, timeline, or scope has slipped.

- A GOOD project manager promises only to keep the clients updated and apprised of budget, timeline, or scope changes the moment they are discovered.

- A GREAT project manager determines which two are most important to the client, gives the clients a range-based estimate for the third variable and keep the client updated on the variations of the third variable at the estimate is refined over the course of the project.

- A FANTASTIC project manager teaches his clients about the Iron Triangle, and teaches them to inherently accept and monitor the uncertainty on the third dimension.

### How This Looks In Practice

Gary: "We're looking to create a software tool that allows users to provide their stock trades which calculates their tax liability for a specific tax year. You'll be managing this project."

You: "That sounds fantastic. How fast would you be hoping to have this project rolled out to our users?"

Gary: "With the new tax laws if we could be first to market incorporating with the changes, we would have a huge advantage over our competitors. That gives us 9 months to finish this."

You: "Makes sense. What are your thoughts on how many members we could assign to this project?"

Gary: "This will be our company's #2 priority for this year. As long as you don't take anyone off of Project Ocelot, it can be as many as the project needs."

You: "Great. How flexible are the project requirements? What are the absolute essentials that we have to have in the first public rollout?"

Gary: "All the tax laws need to be accounted for. Users needs to be able to connect their stock trading accounts from at the least the biggest 20 online brokerages. All the calculations must be correct."

By explicitly putting out feelers towards each of the three variables, you have learned that the minimum Scope is fixed and the Timeline is very important. This means that mentally, you know the only variable you want to be flexible is the Resourcing. In many real-world projects, the cost isn't represented with simple currency amounts. It's often represented by manpower, materials, outsourcing, required tools, and so forth.

### Final Project Output

You may have noticed that in the center of the Iron Triangle is the word Quality. This represents the final project output.

The more time, resources, and scope you have, the higher a project's quality can be. With less time, smaller scope, and smaller resources, the smaller and less refined the project will be.

This isn't necessarily the same as project success. You can have a very small project that is wildly successful. The key thing to avoid is having a lopsided distribution.

You may have seen this vivid illustration of the same artist drawing a picture of Spiderman using different time constraints.

<img src="./project-management-varied-time-spiderman-drawing.png">

This is an example of possible outputs with fixed resources, and a fixed scope, but variable time.

Allocating more time may dramatically result in better project quality.

There is a tight balance between the three dimensions, and if you end up with a lopsided variation, the project's final quality is lower. With well-balanced dimensions, the project's final quality will be what you are aiming for.

A successful project manager is aiming for high project quality, and that is much, much more important than a large scope.

### The Iron Triangle is Your Friend

As you are delivering a project, using the Iron Triangle will help you deliver a quality product and reduce the amount of uncertainty inherent in a project.

If you have a project that isn't naturally constrained, such as a research project, or a solo project, you will find that setting constraints will increase your effectiveness at delivering a successful project.

At the beginning of every project, you should know which constraint is necessarily variable, and then monitor that one closely. If you monitor it closely, then you and the team won't be taken by surprise when the inevitable changes occur.

As you gain more experience, you will learn and develop distinct strategies for managing each of the three dimensions that vary. I'll cover more on some of the techniques for each of those later on.

If anyone ever asks you to commit to a project that is constrained in all dimensions, never commit. You absolutely must teach them that it's impossible to constrain all three dimensions, since there are always project unknowns.

Once you have fully internalized the Iron Triangle, you are well on your way to delivering highly leveraged value, which increases your personal value and your ability to undertake larger, more complex, and more meaningful projects.
