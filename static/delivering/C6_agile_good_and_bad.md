# Chapter 6 - Agile: The Good and Bad

One of the biggest project management revolutions in the past century was Agile. It was created by a prolific group of programmers who noticed that older project management models weren't well suited to software project, since each software project is so unique.

It revolutionized the IT world, and eventually gave birth to practically the entire project management industry. Before that point, project manager wasn't an in-demand job title. People on the project would just manage the projects themselves.

The four key tenets of the Agile Manifesto are:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

There is plenty of controversy over what Agile really is or isn't. There is much disagreement over whether it's made the industry a better or worse place. We don't really care about any of that. You'll form your own opinions on that, if you haven't already.

In this chapter, I'm just going to share my thoughts on the good and bad parts of modern Agile, and how they impact your daily life for managing projects.

## Good Result: Embracing Flexibility

Before the advent of Agile, most projects demanded that all three project input dimensions be locked in place. People wanted fixed timelines, scopes, and costs.

As we've talked about, that's not possible if there are any unknowns or variables. And there are ALWAYS unknowns and variables.

One of the big positive results of the Agile revolution is that many, many more people are familiar with the idea that some variability is necessary.

This is what enables our method of locking in two input dimensions and reassessing the third variable regularly. Because of Agile, most stakeholders are very comfortable with changes as long as they are kept informed about them and have some room to still choose alternate tradeoffs.

## Bad Result: Credentials & Project Masters

One of the major downsides is the hyper-academization of project management. Before the Agile revolution, project management was just something that was naturally done by the team executing the project.

After the Agile revolution, we've seen tons of training courses, certification programs, and seminars emerge. Most of them don't offer much true value. Most of them are a fantastic way to drain companies and individuals of their money and give them little in return. They are pretty damn close to a pure scam.

Similarly, no team actually needs a SCRUM Master or Certified Project Management Professional to succeed. There is no research that shows any benefits to teams run with project managers with formal titles compared with a project being run by a layperson who has solid understanding of project fundamentals, such as what I teach in this book.

## Good Result: Short Feedback Cycles

Before the Agile revolution, often vast reams of documentation was created before a project began. Then, the team would disappear and work on the project for months and months. Finally, months later the team would emerge with something to show.

This huge feedback time delay meant that often what was delivered wouldn't match what was expected. Sometimes the documented specifications were wrong. Sometimes the project wasn't done correctly. Sometimes there were very big undiscovered problems that couldn't be seen until people were using the final output.

After the Agile revolution, people expected to be able to try out the project and see it in action long before it is finished. This is a fantastic thing, since by seeing a project in action, it's much easier to tell what is working well, and what changes are needed.

Very healthy projects provide demos and showcases as often as possible.

The quicker and more often you can get feedback on your project, the healthier and better it will be.

## Bad Result: Over-Reliance On Tools and Processes

Ironically, even though the Agile manifesto explicitly says that we prefer "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools", the exact opposite has happened in most companies that claim they are Agile.

Teams are often burdened with company-standarized process rituals, regardless of whether they offer value. Teams are often required to use specific tools, regardless of whether those tools are helpful or harmful to the project.

I'm not quite certain exactly how this happened, but I've witnessed it at too many companies.

What's the antidote?

Use very simple tools. Don't spend much time in your project tools. People should be spending most of their time and energy working on the project.

Constantly evaluate your processes. If it doesn't work for someone on the team, try something else. Processes are meant to conform to the team. The team is not supposed to conform to a process. Feel free to quit any process that people dislike, or that makes more work, or that makes the project harder.

Less is more. Simpler is better. Mandated tools and processes are the opposite of Agile.

## Good Result: Short Iterations

One big benefit of Agile is that people realize that a healthy project has momentum. You can tell if you momentum if things are regularly delivered.

How can you deliver progress regularly?

- Very small tasks
- Small feature slices
- Time-boxed Sprints
- Frequent software deployments
- Etc.

It's better to deliver 10 tiny tasks a day than 1 task. It's bettter to have 5 2-week iteractions than a 10-week whole project.

On enterprise projects, I have a standing rule that no ticket should take more than 1 workday to complete, from start to finish.

On other project, I have a rule that says tickets should represent 15-90 minutes of work, and most of them should be towards the lower end of the spectrum.

Just a few of the many benefits of short iterations:
- Short iterations increase the number of feedback cycles
- Short iterations capitalize on natural human energy
- Short iterations reduce the cost of context-switching
- Short iterations yield frequent progress which gives the incredible feeling of flow
- Short iterations ensure that the changes can't be disastrous, since the project is known to have been in a good state very recently

The focus on short iterations and rapid feedback is one of the very best results of the Agile revolution.

## Agile Takeaways

Those are some of the best and worst results of the Agile revolution. You may find other things you like or dislike.

My key advice is that you shouldn't get religiously invested in any particular idea or approach. Take the good and avoid the bad.

Find out what works for you.

Find out what works for your team.

Change anything that is't working well.

What are the big takeaways from Agile for me?
- Embrace flexibility
- Get frequent feedback
- Aim for short iterations and units of work
- Don't be rigid about your tools or process
- Avoid the Agile Project Management scams and titles
