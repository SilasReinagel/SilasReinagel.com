# Chapter 1 - No Bullshit Project Management

Project Management, at its core, is very simple.

The primary goal of a project manager is **to take a project all the way from conception to successful completion.**

The secondary goals of a project manager are to bring a project to completion **efficiently and predictably**

Everything else that you will ever learn or do in project management are just strategies and techniques for one of those three goals.

1. Bring the project to successful completion
2. Bring the project to completion efficiently
3. Bring the project to completion predictably

That is also the order of priorities you must have. It doesn't matter how efficient a project is if it never completed. It doesn't matter how predictable a project is, if it's a failure.

As a project manager, all you need to know is what it takes to successfully bring a project to completion, efficiently and predictably.

To be effectively able to deliver projects successfully, time and time again, you need to know what causes projects to succeed and fail.

## Successful Vs Failing Projects

The key factors that impact a project's success are:
1. Great project management
2. A strong project team
3. Sufficient resources
4. Good planning/research/design

If you've got those four factors covered for a project, it's a near certainty that the project will succeed.

If any one of those are factors are missing, the success project may be at risk.

If more than one factor is missing, it's highly unlikely the project will succeed.

Never choose to manage a project that you know is unlikely to succeed. It's a poor use of your time, and may hurt your career. Either change the frame so that you can solve for the problemmatic factors, or go find a different project completely.

Sometimes, the smartest decision is not to undertake a project that is setup to fail.

On the other hand, a good manager is often able to change the circumstances of the project and help ensure that all the factors ARE covered before a project really gets underway.

## 1. Great Project Manangement

By the time you finish this book, and apply these lessons on a few successful projects, this will be you. You will be equipped with everything you need to manage a project of any size. The same core skills are required no matter what kind of project you are managing and no matter how big the scope.

Therefore, if you are managing the project, either explicitly or practically, this factor is covered.

What if you are on a project, and there is another designated project manager? That's fine. If the PM is great, then everything is set. But, even if you don't have a great PM, you can effectively perform nearly all of the project management duties without formally being the project manager. I have done this for years, and taught many PMs valuable techniques and mentalities for managing projects even as, formally, an individual contributor.

It doesn't matter what the titles are. It only matters if the project is managed well. Anyone with these skills can cause a project to be successfully delivered.

If you have mastered the contents of this book, and you are on the team, this factor is covered.

## 2. Strong Project Team

Whether the team consists of 1 member or 20, you need a strong project team. Without a team that's equipped to tackle the project objectives, it's not possible to succeed.

The stronger the team is, the more coordinated they are, and the more motivated they are, the better the project outcome will be.

Having the right team for a project is so important, that I have dedicated two entire chapters to Assembling and Motivating your team.

## 3. Sufficient Resources

Many project management books and programs put this as the key area of consideration. To me, this is the third factor, not the first or even the second.

You need the right resources, certainly. Having a strong project team could even be considered a resourcing issue. But, in my mind, treating people just as a resourcing issue misses how impactful people are and the magic they bring, both individually and as a team.

Since this is the simplest and most traditional factor in project management, we will cover it in the next chapter. You need to ensure that a project has enough time, funding, and a properly-sized scope to match.

If you don't have enough resources to complete a project, it won't be completed. It's as simple as that.

## 4. Good Planning, Research & Design

While it's often true that the project itself will include a good amount of research and design, it's also very important not to begin a project until enough planning has already happened.

- What is the purpose of this project?
- Whose problem will it solve?
- What are the unstated project requirements?
- What are the undiscovered project requirements?
- How much time should this project take?
- How much money should this project cost?
- What people will be needed to complete this project?
- What are the success criteria?

You need to have a very clear picture of all of this before a project begins. Beginning without a plan is very risky.

There can be unknowns, going into a project. But, they should be KNOWN unknowns. You should know exactly which things aren't known yet, and roughly how long it will take to find them out. The more unknowns there are, the more resources will be needed to complete the project.

If you've done good planning and initial research, then you set yourself and the project up for a much easier time throughout the entire process.

You can successfully complete projects will less planning, but it's a much more uphill battle.

## What is expected of you?

When you are managing a project, you are either a powerful leader, moving heaven and earth to deliver the project, or you are a powerless scapegoat at the whims of a cruel and chaotic environment.

This is true whether you are managing your own projects, or managing a project for a client or employer. If you aren't leading proactively with great initiative, then when the project doesn't come to fruition, you will have many feeble complaints about the project when it's over.

I know, because I have experience both of these outcomes many times in my project management journey. I find that I am the most disappointed when one of my projects wasn't completed as successfully as I wanted.

At every moment in a project, you are expected to be able to have a ready answer for the following questions:

- What progress has been made?
- What work still remains?
- Can I see the current progress for myself?
- When will the project be completed?
- How much more will the project cost?

## Our Project Management Learning

Throughout this book, I will share with you the key mental tools you need to fully solve the project management process.

We're going to be covering:
- How to conceptualize key project constraints
- How to measure and build project momentum
- How to provide perfect project predictability
- What tools are need to manage projects
- Good & Bad things about popular project management frameworks
- How to assemble a strong project team
- How to motivate your team
- How to communicate project results and progress

All of those are just supporting pieces on how to accomplish the three goals of a project manager. So, these three goals are the point of everything that follows:

1. Bring the project to successful completion
2. Bring the project to completion efficiently
3. Bring the project to completion predictably
