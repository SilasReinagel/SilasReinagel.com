# Chapter 9 - Assembling Your Team

There are many factors that impact the success of a project. In my experience, the two very biggest factors are:

1. The Project management
2. The Project team

We've covered the big keys to managing a project well. The last key piece of the puzzle is the team.

You need to have the right team for your project.

What makes a good project team?

- Clear Roles
- Crisp Communication
- Core Competencies
- Compelling Motivation
- Knowledge Shards

You're going to need these elements whether you have an in-house team, or contractors. It's essential no matter what the financing model is. It's crucial whether you have a very small team, or a very large one.

## Core Competencies

For serious projects, you need people with the domain skills the project needs. While, you can technically assign any roles/tasks to any team member, successful projects require serious domain expertise.

The precise domain skills needed differ for each project.

On a typical business software project, you'll usually need frontend development, backend development, deployment and operations, and a problem domain expert, at the very least.

On a game development project, you'll usually need character art, environment art, user interface design, gameplay programming, sound, music, marketing, user testing, and deployment.

You don't necessarily need a different person to have a specific competency. You might have one to three senior team members who have the strongest competencies and who can guide more junior team members.

If you're working solo, you might be trying to tackle all the required competencies. Nearly all projects are more successful with at least a small team, but sometimes cost limitations are a real constraint.

Before starting your project, ensure that the project can afford the core required competencies. Determine which project elements don't require as much expertise, and which elements require high-level mastery. If you are missing a missing-critical competency, the project is in big trouble, even if this doesn't become clear until the end.

### Story Time:

One of the worst project failures I ever had was due to missing a competency in a critical role.

My team was building a role-playing game on a very tight schedule with a fixed budget. I assigned our two senior developers to environment/level design, and story/progression/world/flow design. I assigned a passionate and smart junior developer to be our battle systems engineer. While his math skills were brilliant, he was missing the creative design aspect needed to create interesting enemies and put them into the game.

One-third of the way through the project timeline, I noticed that we didn't have any battles in-game yet. I consulted with our battle systems engineer, and he assured me that everything was right on schedule. He had been working with another teammate on implementing the battle skills we needed, and they were nearly done. Once the battle skills were implemented, it would be very easy to populate the game with enemies and battles.

Two-thirds of the way through the project timeline, everything else in the project was coming along great. We had maps, items, shops, backstory, cutscenes, and everything... except there were no battles in the game. If you have ever played a role-playing game, you know how important battles are for the player experience! I consulted with our battle systems engineer, and he was very excited that many more complex battle skills had been implemented. He told me that once the battle skills were all implemented, it would be very easy to populate the game with enemies and battles.

At this point, I knew the project was in big trouble. You can't create and populate a full RPG game with diverse and interesting battles in the final iteration of a project. So, I assembled the team, and we quickly pulled both senior developers off of their roles and had them work to create enemies and fill the world with battles and interesting boss fights.

As a result, to meet our timeline, we had to cut about half of the planned (and nearly finished) content from the game.

What's the big point of the story?

Make absolutely sure that you have the key required competencies covered at the start of a project, or as close to the start as possible. A weakness in one core area can negate a TON of progress and quality in any other areas.

## Clear Roles

For a team to work well, everyone needs to know exactly what they are doing.

- Who is doing which part?
- Who should X ask for guidance or content approval?

Roles are usually organized around competencies, but not always.

From my experience, every key competency needs to have one dedicated lead role. So, you can have 4 environment artists and 1 lead enviroment artist.

If you are missing any lead roles, you will find that either wasteful conflict or directionlessness will occur.

For non-key competencies and non-lead roles, there is a great opportunity for teaching people, sharing knowledge, and expanding competencies. You can assign someone new to a skill to shadow or collaborate on the project. Suppose you've got a UX Designer who wants to learn some frontend programming, you can assign them a Frontend Programming role on a the project, and they can learn through practice.
