# Chapter 3 - Project Momentum

**What's the primary goal of a project manager?**

- To successfully deliver the project

**What are the biggest reasons for a project to fail?**

- Improper constraining of scope, time, or costs.

The answers to these two questions leave us with a good picture of ways for a project to fail. But, we still don't yet have a clear picture of how a project succeeds.

## The #1 Best Project Health Metric

What is the best way to measure the health of a project?

### **Momentum**

When a project has momentum, it is very healthy.

What does project momentum look like?

A project has momentum when the project evolves and moves towards its goals at a predictable and consistent pace. People are excited about it! Tasks are being completed. Conversations are being sparked about the implementation details. New demos and screenshots are being released frequently.

You can tell there is project momentum when there is measurable progress combined with good hype!

If a project is missing either of these two things, that's a very bad sign. Without progress, the project is not moving forward technically. It doesn't matter how excited people are, if the project isn't closer to a reality today than it was yesterday. Without hype, it doesn't matter how fast it gets built because the stakeholders or customers aren't mentally feeling it.

These are the two components of this momentum you are looking for:

1. Hype - Social Momentum
2. Measurable Progress - Technical Momentum

## How To Get Momentum?

To have momentum, you only need a few elements.

### 1. Right Team Members

You need to have the right team. The team should be excited about the project. Each team member must have a personal vested interest in the project.

You need to have people who are technically capable of delivering the project. If you have the wrong people or put people in the wrong roles, that will show up later and hurt the project momentum.

### 2. Clear Vision

Your team needs to have a good understanding of *what* is being made, *why* it matters, and *how* it is being made. This is no easy task!

There must be a clear and shared understanding of the **problem space**.

- What will the product do?
- What will it enable its users to do?
- What need does it fulfill?

Also, there must be a clear and shared understanding of the **solution space**.

- What pieces will be in the final project?
- How will they all work together?
- Who is doing which part?

Teams who have a shared understanding of the project and a shared vision for how to deliver it will always outperform teams who don't hold a common vision.

### 3. Hype People

Someone must be the project cheerleader! They must be excited about it!

This is both outward-facing (marketing) and inward-facing (motivation). Stakeholders need to be hyped about the project as it is in motion, so that it maintains or increases its momentum.

Team members need to stay excited about what they are building. If you don't have someone generating this hype, it's very easy for a project to lose momentum.

### 4. Measurable Deliverables

The human brain is not very well equipped to deal with uncertainty. Because of this, people absolutely must have a way to know how much of the project has been delivered and how close it is to being done.

There is nothing more exciting than seeing shots from a couple of weeks ago compared to what the project looks like now. That's a momentum builder!

Seeing a thermometer fill a bit every day, or a bunch of sticky notes move across a board, or a number of items get crossed off of a finite checklist feels exciting! Everyone can **feel** how close the project is getting to completion, even if it still remains a long way off.

## Project Health Diagnostic

Together, with the Iron Triangle, you have a full picture of both aspects of project health.

You can see if the project is unhealthy by determining if any of its constraints have gone off the rails.

You can see if the project is healthy by looking at the project's momentum, both socially and technically.

If you can see those two things about a project at any point in time, then you know EXACTLY how successful the project is doing, and, as a powerful bonus, you can accurately predict how the project will finish. Nothing is left to chance.

If you master this paradigm of mentally visualizing the project's health, people will think you are FORTUNE TELLER. They will give you better projects, a nicer office, and more money.
