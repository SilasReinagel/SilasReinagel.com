# Chapter 1 - No Bullshit Project Management

Project Management, at its core, is very simple.

The primary goal of a project manager is **to take a project all the way from conception to successful completion.**

The secondary goals of a project manager are to bring a project to completion **efficiently and predictably**

Everything else that you will learn or do in project management are just strategies and techniques for one of those three goals.

1. Bring the project to successful completion.
2. Complete the project efficiently.
3. Complete the project predictably.

The core challenge you are facing is the issue of constraints.

## Example Project

> Note: Throughout this book, I will refer to the following example project to illustrate various project management techniques.

----

You just started a new job as a Project Manager. After your intial week of orientation, Gary, the VP of Product Development comes to you and says:

"We're looking to create a software tool that allows users to provide their stock trades which calculates their tax liability for a specific tax year. You'll be managing this project."

## Identify Your Constraints

To solve the problem of how to bring this project to completion, there are many invisible things you must know.

- What are the unstated project requirements?
- What are the undiscovered project requirements?
- How much time should this project take?
- How much money should this project cost?
- What people will be needed to complete this project?

If you fail to account for any of these constraints, your project will be at risk.

Your natural fight against the odds is expressed with the pithy expression that:

> Every project is over budget and behind schedule from the moment it begins.

## What is expected of you?

When you are managing a project, you are either a powerful leader, moving heaven and earth to deliver the project, or you are a powerless scapegoat at the whims of a cruel and chaotic environment.

This is true whether you are managing your own projects, or managing a project for a client or employer. If you aren't leading proactively with great initiative, then when the project doesn't come to fruition, you will have many feeble complaints about the project when it's over.

I know, because I have experience both of these outcomes many times in my project management journey. I find that I am the most disappointed when one of my own projects wasn't completed as successfully as I wanted.

At every moment in a project, you are expected to be able to have a ready answer for the following questions:

- What progress has been made?
- What work still remains?
- Can I see the current progress for myself?
- When will the project be completed?
- How much more will the project cost?

Juggling these constraints mentally is much easier with the concept of the Iron Triangle, which I will teach you about in the very next chapter.
