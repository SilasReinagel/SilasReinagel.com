# Introduction

There is a vast Project Management industry dedicated to training people and transforming company processes.

It's a very credentialed industry.

It's a very profitable industry.

But, the problem is, most of it is pure bullshit. And much of it is counterproductive.

How do I know?

In my career, I've managed over 200 projects, ranging from IT projects to house renovations.

I've managed projects for teams in sizes ranging from 2-50.

I've managed projects with remote team members all over the world, working in different time zones and with varying levels of fluency.

It's true that project management is very important.

But, it's not very complex.

You need to know only a few key things and if you put in a bit of practice, you can be a fantastic project manager.

I've written this book to teach you how to manage projects and focus on the key things that matter while avoiding wasteful, costly, and demoralizing mistakes.

Who is this book for?

This book is for anyone who:
- Takes initiative
- Wants to create things
- Wants to be entrusted with more significant problems to solve
- Wants to earn more money
- Wants to amplify their ability to make things happen

This book is written for the busy individual who doesn't want to sit through hours of formal academic training or pay $500 for tests to prove something that your portfolio can clearly demonstrate.

Effective project management skills will improve your ability to organize teams, generate business value, get corporate promotions, increase your salary, start your own business, or even accomplish creative things like composing music, writing books, creating art, or numerous other things.

I know your time is valuable!

That’s why I’ve written short chapters so that you can quickly absorb the key information.

If you read and absorb this information, you will be well equipped with what you need to master project management.

I'm not one of those authors who writes pages upon pages, repeating the same information, again and again, to get it into your head.

Instead of so much repetition, I end each chapter with review questions so that you can discover if you fully absorbed the key points it presents. If you can answer all the questions for a chapter, then feel free to move on to the next. If you have trouble recalling some answers, go back and re-read the chapter until you can effortlessly answer the review questions.
