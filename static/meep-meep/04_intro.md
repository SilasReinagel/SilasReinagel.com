# Introduction

When I was a child, my parent didn't keep a TV set at home. But, whenever I went over to my grandparents house, I wanted to watch cartoons. Of all the cartoons I watched, my very favorite featured Wily E. Coyote and the Road Runner.

Wile E. Coyote would hatch fiendishly complex schemes to catch the Road Runner, hoping to eat him. Road Runner managed to avoid nearly all of these wild schemes without almost any effort. Road Runner would just run around (at hypersonic speeds), each bird seed very carefully, and avoid doing anything particularly stupid. Ok, the Road Runner also sometimes broke the laws of physics and altered the nature of reality, effortlessly.

I don't know precisely why, but I always loved how the Road Runner came out ahead, just by being blisteringly fast and not getting involved in things that were too complex. Ever since, I've had a love for simplicity and for speed (at least in applicable domains... don't get smart with me!).

Those two ideas are pillars in the way I do software engineering. They serve as effective guidepoints in engineering things elegantly.

Enter Web Development.

I've been doing professional web development since I was 19. I've seen a LOT of websites, design trends, and technology trends. You name, I've seen it.

One thing seems to have been lost along the way.

Web sites have gotten bigger and larger.

They have grown bigger often a pace faster than hardware and network improvements.

What's the result?

Painfully slow web sites and apps.
