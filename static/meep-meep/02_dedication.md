# Dedication

----

This book is dedicated to the software engineers who are committed to their craft.

It is dedicated to people who think that computers and software should run blazingly fast.

It is dedicated to web developers who want to deliver the very best experiences to their users.

It's also dedicated to [Jose Rosado](https://twitter.com/JoseRosado), who inspired me to begin writing instead of spending too much time planning, researching, and generally overthinking things.

Thank you for supporting my writings. I hope they greatly benefit you!
