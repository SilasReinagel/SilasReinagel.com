# Becoming a DevOps Organization

Carvana is in an incredible place in the business marketplace. We're dominating the car sales market and growing at exponential rate. As a technology company, we also aspire to become a world-class technology company.

## How can Carvana become a world-class technology company?

Mantras are easy. However, real change and evolution are hard. How can we, at Carvana, become a world-class technology company?

One of the biggest and most profound innovations in the software engineering space is the DevOps movement. Some have said "DevOps is just the agile principle, taken to the full organization."

**Carvana can become a world-class technology company by becoming a DevOps Organization.** We shouldn't just have some people "doing DevOps" (which is anti-thetical to the core ideas of DevOps); instead Carvana should be a DevOps company. Every engineering team should be a DevOps team. 

In order for Carvana to become a DevOps organization, we first need to understand the core philosophy of DevOps, which is mostly an adaption of tried and proven principles that originated in the Manufacturing industry.

## What is DevOps?

DevOps, at it core, is a philosophy which conists of three guiding principles. 

Any team that is following these 3 principles as their guiding pillars in their daily work is a DevOps team. 

### Principle 1: The Principle of Flow

The principle of flow is about how value is delivered. In a healthy system, all of the following are true:
- Every deliverable directly improves someone's life
- All work is highly visible
- Work flows in one direction
- Work flows at a reasonable and consistent rate

You can measure the health of the value delivery pipeline using metrics such as:
- Work throughput (how much value is delivered)
- Work lead time (how long it takes for a work item to be delivered)
- Defect rate (how often work needs to be send backwards to correct flaws)

Incorporating the principle of flow into your daily work means being conscious of how work is moving (or not moving) through the system.

### Principle 2: The Principle of Feedback

The principle of feedback is about optimizing and amplifying feedback mechanisms in order to best deliver value. In a healthy system, all of the following are true:
- Defects are found as swiftly as possible
- Customers and requesters issues can be swiftly resolved
- Team members are empowered to stop a project if a major problem arises

You can measure the health of the feedback system using metrics such as:
- Amount of time between a defect being created and detected
- Satisfaction of downstream teams at having their issues resolved

Incorporating the principle of flow into your daily work means that it's more important to fix impedients to delivering value (system improvement) than to deliver an individual work items. 

### Principle 3: The Principle of Continous Improvement

The principle of continuous improvement is about capitalizing on gains and eliminating deficiencies. 

This is what allows compound gains, where each improve make the whole system better, which then enables the system to deliver value faster and improve itself faster. This is the key principle that is responsible for experiences like the Amazon Flywheel effect. The better your system is, the easier it is to improve further. 

Also, this principle is necessary to counteract the principle of entropy. Systems naturally decay and trend towards disorder. Therefore, even if you wish to keep things running the same, it is necessarily to continually apply effort to improve the system. The worse your system is, the harder it will be to deliver value, and the harder it will be to improve it.

In a healthy system, all of the following are true:
- Every team member spends at least 20% of his work time improving the current system
- Flow metrics are trending upwards over time
- Defect rates are trending downwards over time
- Satisfaction levels are trending upwards over time

This will never happen by accident. Instead, it happens as an organization applies consistent, intentional effort to improve the system. 

This also necessarily includes experiementation. Sometimes it is unclear how a particular piece of a system can be improved. In a situation of uncertainty, the bst path forward is to try an experiment and then measure the results to see if the system has improved. Experimental changes that yield improvements should be incorporated into the system. 

Incorporating the principle of continuous improvement in your daily work means always looking for pain points or opportunities. Anytime Flow or Feedback elements of the system can be improved, those should be prioritized over delivering ordinary business value.

## Summary

In order for Carvana to become a world-class technology organization, we need to become an organization that is guided by DevOps principles. We need to be a DevOps organization.

We can achieve this by helping each other to apply the principles of Flow, Feedback, and Continual Improvement to our daily work process, and letting them guide us. 

We should cultivate a deep knowledge of these three principles through studying them further. 

We should develop a rich DevOps praxis by using that knowledge to improve how we work, as individuals, as teams, as departments, and as an organization.

This is the DevOps way. 

This is the path for Carvana to become a world-class Technology Organization. 

We welcome all of you on this shared journey!
