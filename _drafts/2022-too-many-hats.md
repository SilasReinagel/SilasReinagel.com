You get the best results in anything when you have focus. Someone who is focused and dedicated to solving a focused set of problems yields the very best results. This has been one of the massive learning of our age and why specialization and expertise is so strongly rewarded. 

We may have leaders who are good at all these different things. It's unlikely for one individual to be good at all these things, but it's possible. It's even possible, but extremely rare, for one individual to be great at all these things. However, what virtually never happens is for a individual who is personally dedicated to doing all these things to also have enough time to do them all well. 

When you try to do too many different things in a fixed amount of time, it's possible for them to happen (again, unlikely), but if they are done, it's at a reduced level of quality.
