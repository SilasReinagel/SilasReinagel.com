In the realm of agent systems, whether powered by human intelligence or artificial intelligence, there exists a fundamental concept that drives task accomplishment: the Core Value Loop. This simple yet powerful cycle forms the backbone of how agents operate to achieve their missions.

This diagram illustrates the Core Value Loop in agent systems, showing the cyclical nature of Planning, Executing, and Evaluating in pursuit of a mission goal.

## The Core Value Loop

Every agent system begins with a top-level mission. Once established, the system enters a recursive loop consisting of three key steps:

1. **Plan**: Develop a strategy to progress towards the mission goal.
2. **Execute**: Carry out the planned actions.
3. **Evaluate**: Assess the results and adjust the approach as needed.

This cycle continues until the mission is accomplished or terminated.

## Phase Details

### 1. Plan

The planning phase is crucial for any agent system. It involves:

- Analyzing the current state and available resources
- Breaking down the mission into manageable sub-tasks
- Prioritizing actions based on importance and feasibility
- Anticipating potential obstacles and devising contingencies

In today's agentic systems, planning capabilities vary widely. Simple rule-based agents can follow predetermined decision trees, while more advanced AI systems can use techniques like Monte Carlo Tree Search or Reinforcement Learning to develop sophisticated strategies. However, long-term planning and handling highly complex, open-ended scenarios remain challenging for most current AI systems.

### 2. Execute

Execution is where plans are put into action. This phase involves:

- Carrying out the planned tasks in a systematic manner
- Adapting to real-time changes in the environment
- Coordinating actions if multiple agents are involved
- Collecting data on the outcomes of each action

Current agentic systems excel at execution in well-defined domains. For instance, robotic systems can perform precise manufacturing tasks, and AI agents can execute complex strategies in games like chess or Go. However, general-purpose execution in unstructured real-world environments remains a significant challenge, especially when it comes to physical manipulation or understanding context in human interactions.

### 3. Evaluate

The evaluation phase is critical for learning and improvement. It includes:

- Analyzing the results of executed actions
- Comparing outcomes to expected results
- Identifying successes, failures, and areas for improvement
- Updating the agent's knowledge base or model

Modern AI systems have made significant strides in evaluation, particularly in domains with clear metrics. Machine learning models can automatically adjust based on performance data, and reinforcement learning agents can optimize their strategies through repeated interactions. However, evaluating success in more abstract or subjective domains, such as creative tasks or complex human interactions, remains a challenge for current AI systems.

## Current Capabilities and Limitations

Today's agentic systems, particularly those powered by AI, have shown remarkable capabilities in specific domains:

- They excel at pattern recognition and data analysis
- Can make rapid decisions based on vast amounts of information
- Are capable of continuous learning and improvement in well-defined tasks

However, they also face significant limitations:

- Struggle with generalizing knowledge across different domains
- Often lack common sense reasoning and contextual understanding
- Have difficulty with long-term planning in open-ended scenarios
- May fail to recognize their own limitations or when to seek human intervention
- Make mistakes that are hard to detect and correct
- Sometimes hallucinate or make up information that doesn't exist due to their natures

As research progresses, we can expect these systems to become more versatile and capable of handling increasingly complex missions across a wider range of domains. The Core Value Loop of Plan-Execute-Evaluate will remain central to this evolution, guiding the development of more sophisticated and effective agent systems.

## Universal Application

What's fascinating about the Core Value Loop is its universality. Whether we're talking about AI-driven systems, human-led projects, or hybrid approaches, this concept remains constant. It's the fundamental process by which real-world tasks of value are accomplished.

From agile software development sprints to complex AI decision-making algorithms, the Plan-Execute-Evaluate loop is omnipresent. It allows for continuous improvement, adaptation to changing circumstances, and efficient progress towards goals.

Understanding and implementing this Core Value Loop concept can significantly enhance the effectiveness of any agent system, regardless of its specific domain or the nature of its intelligence.

As we continue to develop more sophisticated AI and human-AI collaborative systems, the Core Value Loop will undoubtedly remain a crucial element in designing effective, goal-oriented agents.
