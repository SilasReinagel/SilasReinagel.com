Ever since the Agile movement gained massive popularity and adoption in every company that works with software, daily standup meetings have become a central ritual. They are nearly universal. And they are universally a waste. If your team has access to modern tools such as Github, Trello, Jira, or Google Docs, then daily standup only serve to waste valuable company money and interrupt the most precious development hours of the day. I know you want some more detailed reasons, so read on, and I will tell you all about it.

It's morning in the office. You've had your first coffee and are debating whether to grab your second cup right now or a bit later. You were working on coding a new feature, but with standup looming near, there's no point in trying to write more code, since your train of thought will be broken momentarily. You leave your standing desk for some idle chat with a team member for a minute or two.

You and your teammates walk across the building into an ornate conference room boasting the latest and greatest communication devices. Everyone briefly makes small talk while one team member spends 5 minutes fumbling around with the meeting app, trying to get the remote team members dialed in, making sure the sound and picture are actually showing up correctly. 

Finally, someone pulls up a tool that shows the current team work backlog. There are columns, cards, terse, titles, colored labels, cute team member avatars and all of the other wonderful features of a modern work-tracking system. After that high point, for some mysterious reason, everyone pretends that they don't understand all of this rich information presented on the screen. 

So, starting with some arbitrarily chosen team member, everyone goes around the room explaining what work they did on the previous day (which is visible on the screen already), explaining what work task they are currently engaged in (which is also visible on the screen already), and what tasks are blocked or in trouble (which, as you may have guess, is also represented with status flags on the screen already). 

The efficient team members give a few terse sentences saying exactly what is on the screen. 
The happy team members launch into short tales of their great victories.
The lazy team members conjure up excuses for why their tickets aren't finished.
The bored team members mumble a few incoherent sentences, while everyone nods along.
The frustrated team members complain about something that they feel is slowing them down. 
The sarcastic team members cracks a dry joke or two during their tale.
The leaders throw in a few questions about when a feature will be fully done.
The project manager tosses in a remark about how a label is missing from one ticket.

If you're been working with software for any amount of time, you've experience your version of this ritual too many times to count.

Historically, I don't deny, the daily standup meeting was a very useful tool. It accomplishes a few things very well:

- Helps socially synchronize work for tasks which take more than 1 work day.
- Publically shames people who aren't making apparent progress.
- Provides valuable status updates to people who aren't regularly using the software.
