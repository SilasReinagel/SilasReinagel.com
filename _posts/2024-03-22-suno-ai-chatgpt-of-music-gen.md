Music Generative AI has been lagging behind other generative mediums for some time. But there's a new player in the game, and it seems that we're on the brink of a revolution. I tried out Suno AI, and I'm honestly... impressed! Read on to learn a little more before you head over to try it yourself (you really must!).

## Advanced Music Generation Capabilities

What sets Suno AI apart is its ability to generate completely original, broadcast-ready music tailored to the user's preferences. Unlike other AI music tools that simply stitch together pre-made samples, Suno AI crafts instrumental tracks from scratch using sophisticated machine learning models. 

### The Bark and Chirp Models

Under the hood, Suno AI is powered by two specialized models working in tandem:

1. The "Bark" model focuses on generating vocals and lyrics
2. The "Chirp" model handles the creation of instrumental backing tracks

By dividing and conquering, these models enable Suno AI to produce complete songs with both vocals and instrumentation, all generated from just a text prompt. It's like having a full music production studio at your fingertips.

### Empowering Musical Creativity for All

What's truly exciting about Suno AI is how it makes music creation accessible to everyone. While it can be used by award-winning artists, the majority of Suno's user base consists of everyday people, many of whom are composing music for the first time. Suno removes the barriers of musical training and expensive equipment, allowing anyone to create radio-quality songs in minutes.

### Thoughts as a Musician

As a musician, I wouldn't consider Suno AI's generations as great as traditional music, but the quality bar has genuinely been raised here. This seems like an incredible tool for creating background music, music for fun, or even quickly prototyping some lyrical or musical ideas. 

There are also some nice power tools already available here, especially with the ability to use continuations, and provide your own lyrics. I honestly can't wait to see how this evolves, and already I can absolutely see using this in place of stock music when I'm doing video project, game jams, and fast prototypes.
